## Overview

This repository contains a collection of neural network projects developed during my studies in Artificial Intelligence. The projects demonstrate various deep learning techniques, architectures, and applications.


## Projects

### [CNN Image Classification](./CNN-Image-Classification)
Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with optimizations like batch normalization and dropout.


### [ResNet CIFAR-10 Analysis](./ResNet-CIFAR10-Analysis)
Comparative analysis of different ResNet architectures (ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, examining trade-offs between model depth, accuracy, and training time.


### [Optimizers Comparison ANN](./OptimizersComparisonANN)
Performance evaluation of various optimization algorithms (SGD, Momentum SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad) for training neural networks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
